PassWords
=========

PassWords generates strong passwords that are easy to remember using the method described in XKCD comic #936. Randall Munroe's comic shows that a passphrase of four common words would take 550 years to guess at 1000 guesses/sec. Each word is chosen at random using the SecureRandom Android API from a dictionary of 7072 common English words.
